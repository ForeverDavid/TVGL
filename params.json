{"name":"TVGL: Tessellation and Voxelization Geometry Library","tagline":"A .NET managed library for computaional geometry functions for tessellated or voxelized solids.","body":"# Tesselation and Voxelization Geometry Library #\r\n\r\nThis new dynamic library is focused on Computational Geometry functions likes the ones you would find in CGAL. As opposed to copying directly others work, we have sought to create functions from scratch that are optimized or straightforward as a C# implementation. As a .NET managed library (and a portable class library at that), the functions can be accessed from other *managed* code.\r\n\r\n### What is this repository for? ###\r\n\r\n* Reasoning about three dimensional shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How do I get set up? ###\r\n\r\n* Download the Source from BitBucket.\r\n** It is stored as a Mercurial clone. Using your mercurial app, clone the source code (https://MattCampbell@bitbucket.org/MattCampbell/tessellation-and-voxelization-geometry-library)\r\nor\r\n* add to your Visual Studio project with Nuget (http://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-dialog)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
